<p>ScamShield helps protect you from scams by filtering scam SMSes, and blocking
calls from phone numbers used in illegal activities. The ScamShield app
can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for scams:</strong> Enter a suspicious message, link, or
phone number to check if it’s a scam. You can also upload a screenshot
of a message (received via SMS, WhatsApp, or Telegram) to check if it is
likely to be a scam.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Block and filter scams:</strong> Follow step-by-step instructions
to set up your phone to block scam calls and SMSes.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submit scam reports:</strong> Include screenshots when submitting
scam reports, so it’s easier for the police to take action on them. Your
reports help expand our database of scammers, and keep our community safe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Download and set up the ScamShield app for yourself and your loved ones,
for better protection against scams.</p>
<p>ScamShield is developed by Open Government Products (OGP) in collaboration
with the Singapore Police Force (SPF), and the National Crime Prevention
Council (NCPC).</p>
