<p><u>General</u>
<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a Government
Agency digital service.
<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that:&nbsp;
<br>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may use "cookies", where a small data
file is sent to your browser to store and track information about you when
you enter our digital services. The cookie is used to track information
such as the number of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users
and their preferred digital services. While this cookie can tell us when
you enter our digital services and which pages you visit, it cannot read
data off your hard disk.
<br>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can choose to accept or decline cookies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify
your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent
you from taking full advantage of the digital service.
<br>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service may utilise cookies to facilitate
authentication and/or login to the Service. If such cookies are rejected,
you might not be able to use the Service.
<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please see the Annex for any additional
terms or information.&nbsp;
<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing in this Privacy
Statement shall be construed as limiting or prejudicing our rights at law
to collect, use or disclose any data without your consent or agreement.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Use of data</u>
<br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may request or collect
certain types of data from you in connection with your access or use of
the Service. The data that may be requested/collected include those identified
in the Annex herein. Your data may be stored in our servers, systems or
devices, in the servers, systems or devices of our third party service
providers or collaborators, or on your device, and may be used by us or
our third party service providers or collaborators to facilitate your access
or use of the Service. We or our third party service providers or collaborators
may collect system configuration information and/or traffic information
(such as an IP address) and/or use information or statistical information
to operate, maintain or improve the Services or the underlying service
of the third party service provider or collaborator. For the avoidance
of doubt, in this Privacy Statement, a reference to a third party service
provider or collaborator includes other third parties who provide a service
or collaborate with our third party service provider or collaborator.
<br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you provide us with
personal data, or where we collect personal data from you:
<br>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may use, disclose and process the data

<br>6.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to assist, process and facilitate
your access or use of the Service;
<br>6.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to administer, process and facilitate
any transactions or activities by you, whether with us or any other Government
Agency or third party service provider or collaborator, and whether for
your own benefit, or for the benefit of a third party on whose behalf you
are duly authorized to act;
<br>6.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to carry out your instructions or
respond to any queries, feedback or complaints provided by (or purported
to be provided by) you or on your behalf, or otherwise for the purposes
of responding to or dealing with your interactions with us;
<br>6.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to monitor and track your usage of
the Service, to conduct research, data analytics, surveys, market studies
and similar activities, in order to assist us in understanding your interests,
concerns and preferences and improving the Service (including any service
of a third party service provider or collaborator) and other services and
products provided by Government Agencies. For the avoidance of doubt, we
may also collect, use, disclose and process such information to create
reports and produce statistics regarding your transactions with us and
your usage of the Services and other services and products provided by
Government Agencies for record-keeping and reporting or publication purposes
(whether internally or externally);
<br>6.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the purposes of storing or creating
backups of your data (whether for contingency or business continuity purposes
or otherwise), whether within or outside Singapore;
<br>6.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to enable us to contact you or communicate
with you on any matters relating to your access or use of the Service,
including but not limited to the purposes set out above, via email, push
notifications or such other forms of communication that we may introduce
from time to time depending on the functionality of the Service and/or
your device.
<br>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may share necessary data with other Government
Agencies, and third party service providers or collaborators in connection
with the Service, so as to improve or facilitate the discharge of public
functions and/or serve you in the most efficient and effective way, unless
such sharing is prohibited by law.
<br>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may share your personal data with non-Government
Agency entities that have been authorised to carry out specific Government
Agency services. We will NOT share your personal data with other non-Government
Agency entities without your consent, except where such sharing is necessary
for fulfilling any of the purposes herein, or complies with the law.
<br>6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For your convenience, we may also display
to you data you had previously supplied us or other Government Agencies.&nbsp;
This will speed up the transaction and save you the trouble of repeating
previous submissions. Should the data be out-of-date, please supply us
the latest data.
<br>6A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that we may be required to disclose your data
by law, including any law governing the use/provision of any service of
a third party service provider or collaborator.
<br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may withdraw your
consent to the use and disclosure of your data by us with reasonable notice
and subject to any prevailing legal or contractual restrictions; however,
doing so may prevent the proper functioning of the Service and may also
result in the cessation of the Service to you.
<br>
